>Let x be the missing and y be the repeating element.
>Get the sum of all numbers using formula S = n(n+1)/2 – x + y
>Get product of all numbers using formula P = 1*2*3*…*n * y / x
>The above two steps give us two equations, we can solve the equations and get the values of x and y.

This method may cause arithmatic overflow as we calculate product(P)
