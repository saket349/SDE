<h1>Pascal Triangle </h1>
<p><b>Pascal Triangle</b> is a triangular array of the binomial coefficients. Write a function that takes an integer value n as input and prints first n lines of the Pascal’s triangle. Following are the first 6 rows of Pascal’s Triangle.
</p><br>
<p>Question can be asked like print first five rows of pascal triangle or print seventh row only or print fifth row third element </p>
<br>
for finding the value at nth row nd mth  column formula is 
- 
<sup>n-1</sup>C<sub>m-1</sub>
<u>
  <li>
    <br>{time complexity = O(NlogN) + O(N^2); Space complexity = O(N)}</li>
