- Topological sorting for Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) is a linear ordering of vertices such that for every directed edge u v, vertex u comes before v in the ordering. Topological Sorting for a graph is not possible if the graph is not a DAG
- The first vertex in topological sorting is always a vertex with in-degree as 0 (a vertex with no incoming edges)
- **DIFFERENCE BETWEEN DFS AND TOPO SORT**: In DFS, we print a vertex and then recursively call DFS for its adjacent vertices. In topological sorting, we need to print a vertex before its adjacent vertices.
