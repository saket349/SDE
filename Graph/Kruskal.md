- **Kruskalâ€™s Algorithm** builds the spanning tree by adding edges one by one into a growing spanning tree. Kruskal's algorithm follows greedy approach as in each iteration it finds an edge which has least weight and add it to the growing spanning tree
#### Algorithm Steps:-
- Sort the graph edges with respect to their weights
- Start adding edges to the MST from the edges with the smallest weight until the edge of the largest weight
- Only add edges which doesn't from a cycle, edges which connect only disconnected components
