#### Used to find the sortest path from the source node to all other vertices in a weigted graph,
#### A very important application of Bellman Ford is to **check if there is a negative cycle** in the graph, time complexity of the algorithm is relatively high O(n^v) if v=n^2 then complexity becomes O(n^3)
